# For Creators (Updated New GUI)
You can download the template project here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lYe67IK2ogx3TNicxq7vDeAnWxoJWpCg<br />

NOTE: Make sure you import XR Plugin Management into the project and set Plugin Provider to OpenXR then go to OpenXR Tab below it after the Restart and then set Render Mode to Multi-Pass this is to fix your car not rendering in both eyes<br />

How to Set Up Custom Vehicle:<br />

Begin by opening your project and obtaining your car model, preferably from Blender. Ensure that in Blender, you apply rotations to all the wheels before exporting them. To do this, select each wheel, go to Object > Apply > Rotations.<br />

Import the model into the scene and configure it by naming all the wheels correctly. Avoid placing wheel colliders directly on the wheels themselves, as it can lead to issues. Place them on empty gameobjects.<br />

Add a "Descriptor" component to the object, filling in the values (starter values work well).<br />

Create your wheel colliders, which is a straightforward process. If you're unfamiliar with it, you can find tutorials online. then set them correctly in the Descriptor<br />

Attach a Rigidbody component to the parent of the model and set its mass to around 350 for optimal results.<br />

Add a empty gameobject this is where your player will be seated (note: put it far below the car to make your player centered) then set the DrivePoint as this object in the Descriptor<br />

Add a mesh collider to the base of your car and check the "Convex" option but don't press the "Is Trigger" option.<br />

Add a cube to the model, this is the selection point for pointing at the car after making it set the SelectPoint to this in the Descriptor<br />

To export the object in the hierarchy, go to GorillaVehicles/Car Exporter click it then select the Export on the vehicle you want to export<br />

Notes:<br />
You can use the Template Models as a references for the setup.<br />
Parenting doesn't matter; you can organize objects in different parents. Just keep the entire car parented at the position (0,0,0).<br />
Properly align the wheel colliders and set their ranges to the correct size for optimal vehicle performance.<br />
